# My BASH Config
This is my BASH config. I modularise my BASH configs based based off distros. I only make configs for distros that I run. If a config is out of date, it is because I no longer run that distro, and can't be asked to mantain a config for a distro that I don't use. Here are the distros I have configs for:
  - Debian Linux (Out of date)
  - Garuda Linux (In date)
## How to use the configs
To use them, source the bashrc made for your distro in your .bashrc. Example:  
```source ~/.config/bash/garuda_config/bashrc_garuda.sh```
